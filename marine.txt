Marine engineering is the operation, maintenance and monitoring of mechanical systems aboard marine vessels, including boats, ships and submarines. This profession involves the application of different engineering fields, including computer science, electrical engineering, electronic engineering, and mechanical engineering.

Marine engineers will typically have studied marine engineering and are responsible for some or all major mechanical and engineered systems aboard a vessel. These could include systems related to electricity generation, propulsion, fuel, air conditioning, lighting, water distillation, lubrication, electrical and electronic components, and more. 

With working locations including aboard ship, engineers in this profession will typically need to be able to work at sea, including for long durations according to the requirements of their role or employer.

Marine engineering is sometimes used as a catch-all to include other, related, engineering disciplines, including ocean engineering and naval architecture – which we will cover in more detail in the ‘related fields’ section, below.
